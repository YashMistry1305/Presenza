# Presenza
🚀 Overview

Presenza Cloud is a cloud-based automated attendance analysis system that processes CSV attendance data and generates detailed reports of students falling below the 75% attendance threshold (defaulters), along with additional statistical insights.

The generated report is automatically sent to a specified Gmail account, eliminating manual effort and ensuring timely monitoring.
